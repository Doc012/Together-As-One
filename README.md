# Together-As-One
A community-driven web platform created in response to the 16-day water outage in Emfuleni Local Municipality (starting 30 May 2025). This is not a municipal service — it’s a local initiative built by a resident to help neighbors access free borehole water during the crisis.  💧 “When government fails, community rises.”
