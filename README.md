# üåç Emfuleni Water Help ‚Äì *Community First. Together as One.*

**Emfuleni Water Help** is a community-driven web platform created in response to the **16-day water outage** in Emfuleni Local Municipality (starting 30 May 2025).  
This is **not a municipal service** ‚Äî it‚Äôs a local initiative built by a resident to help neighbors **access free borehole water** during the crisis.
